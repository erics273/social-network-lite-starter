## Overview

This is the React front-end starter code you can use to interact with your API. The backend express starter you were provided has authentication built-in. This starter will be ready to work with that authentication. You will use this starter to complete the front-end portion of your capstone.

### Learning Objectives

- Practice building larger applications with React
- Practice building a system architecture for an application
- Practice working with a back-end API
- Practice using a UI component library
- Practice following SCRUM processes and understanding/practicing SCRUM roles
- Practice communicating/working together as a team

## Getting Started...

We will specify the API you will be using to build your project, but the design, layout, and component architecture will be up to you

1. Mock out possible screens
2. Break screens out into possible component names
4. Discuss at what point will you hit the API, use local state, and how components will get the props they need to render
5. Discuss and research what UI component library you would like to use and which components you will use. [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) is already included and being used to style the exisiting components.
6. We recommend experimenting with some components to get comfortable with how they work and which components you could use for which parts of your application.

7. Begin creating/using components to establish a general foundation of your app
